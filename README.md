# Aviation Accidents

This project was made for Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course.

Collaborated with group members and chose the Aviaition Accident dataset to formulate an interesting problem and solve through machine learning.

- Question: Which of the factors (Broad Phase of Flight, Purpose of Flight, Weather Condition) have the largest importance in the classification of severity of accidents?

- Machine Learning method: Classification using Decision tree method. Used confusion matrix between the train and test data. 
- Result: Weather condition was the factor which has the largest importance in the classification of the severity of accidents with a training accuracy of 88% and testing accuracy of 87%.
- Additional:
  - Used a plotly mapbox to visualise the accidents and number of fatalities using a world map and gradient scale to check severity of fatalities.
  - Used anomalies with location (latitude and longitude) along with the number of fatalities in a 3-d plot to check anomalies together.
